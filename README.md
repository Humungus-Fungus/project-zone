 # Solution

Project-Zone Web-App suggests the user about the projects he/she can create based on the skills he/she can choose Like if we learn some new tech, we always search for beginner node projects, beginner projects, and so on, and this, we have to explore a lot on google or YouTube to get the project. So, if we have all these projects in one place it will be very much easy for a developer beginner to find project ideas like we are finding difficulty in finding a project at this time and searching for projects ideas online We can have the categories from beginner to startup level project ideas we can have an option for signed-in users to add a new project if he wants and it can be further improved.
