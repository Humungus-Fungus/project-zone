# Problem
When we participate in Hackathons we always face one issue that is an Idea for Project or inspiration! or usually, when we learn a new skill we find it difficult in what project should we build now.

 >  #### So if you face the same Problem we support you from the back!

 # Solution

Project-Zone Web-App suggests the user about the projects he/she can create based on the skills he/she can choose Like if we learn some new tech, we always search for beginner node projects, beginner projects, and so on, and this, we have to explore a lot on google or YouTube to get the project. So, if we have all these projects in one place it will be very much easy for a developer beginner to find project ideas like we are finding difficulty in finding a project at this time and searching for projects ideas online We can have the categories from beginner to startup level project ideas we can have an option for signed-in users to add a new project if he wants and it can be further improved.
